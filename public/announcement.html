                <h2>Easter Camp</h2>
                <p>Hi all! I hope all have had a fun term so far and are looking forward to our easter break. This term we have camps for the younger kids who will have the opportunity to try their hand at Digital Art and Coding along side each other as we try create some fun and cool websites.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                For the older kids we have two camps which are quite relaxed and creative, where we will be completing a Hackathon to create a JS game using their imagination!
                    <br>
                    <br>

                <h2>2nd class discount</h2>
                <p>We want to encourage kids to take more than one coding class a week. It can be quite a tough skill to pick up, however with the correct amount of exposure the kids will be able to learn how to create and understand complex projects whether they become a Digital Engineer or decide on another direction.</p>
